# Empowering Healthcare Data Systems with an Innovative Chatbot Application Utilizing Python and Advanced Generative AI Models

Abstract—The exponential growth of healthcare data presents
significant challenges in data accessibility, patient engagement,
and operational efficiency. This paper introduces a novel chatbot application that leverages advanced generative AI models,
specifically a fine-tuned LLaMA and an enhanced BioBERT,
to empower healthcare data systems. The chatbot integrates
innovative techniques in natural language processing (NLP),
data preprocessing, and model fine-tuning to handle diverse
tasks such as answering complex medical queries, analyzing
various document types, recognizing medical conditions from prescriptions, and providing personalized health recommendations.
The system’s architecture is designed with scalability and realworld deployment in mind, utilizing asynchronous processing and
optimized model serving strategies. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models in
terms of accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction. Ethical
considerations, including data privacy and compliance with
regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, are thoroughly addressed
to ensure responsible deployment in healthcare settings.

This research illustrates an innovative chatbot application
designed to multi-task processing:
1) Answer complex medical and healthcare-specific queries
with high accuracy.
2) Analyze and summarize a wide range of document types,
including medical reports and prescriptions.
3) Recognize medical conditions from prescriptions using
advanced optical character recognition (OCR) and enhanced NLP techniques.
4) Provide personalized, condition-specific recommendations and general health precautions.
